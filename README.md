# Frontend Chatbot - PAI (Personal AI)

This is the **frontend** of the WebAI project, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and React.  
It provides the user interface for interacting with the AI chatbot powered by a **FastAPI backend** (separate repo: [backend_chatbot](https://github.com/BobKeijzer/backend_chatbot)).

The frontend supports:

- Creating and managing chat sessions  
- Sending messages to the backend AI  
- Uploading files and folders for RAG workflows  
- Viewing chat history and responses  
- Dark mode and responsive layout  

---

## Features

- **Next.js 13** app using app directory & SSR  
- **React hooks** for state management (chats, files, etc.)  
- **File & folder uploads** integrated with backend RAG indexing  
- **Sidebar navigation** for chats and documents  
- **Theme support** with dark/light mode
